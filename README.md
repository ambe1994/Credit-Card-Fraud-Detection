## Model
In this project I have used LogisticRegression model.

## Training and testing
In this model i have used accuracy score to check the accuracy of model.
train_test_split method to to split the data set for training and testing. By using train_test_split method training and testing data is splitted in mutully exclusive manner because of training and testing mutually exclusive, more accurate evaluation on out of sample accuracy.
In this model i have used 80% data for model training and 20% for testing.
